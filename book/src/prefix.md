# Prefix

Though this book is currently in the repository of a bootloader, it contains plans for an operating system. This repository will likely be merged into a monorepo when the related kernel is created.

## Objectives

The main goals for this operating system are to learn stuff and have fun. I simply enjoy designing "bare-metal programs" (programs that run directly on hardware with limited or no firmware) from scratch. :)

I'm trying to keep track of my objectives through a roadmap. This roadmap will be separeted into stages; each with a list of things I want to implement. It can be found [here](./roadmap.md).
