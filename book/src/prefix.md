# Introduction

This bootloader is a hobby project of mine for eventually booting my (to-be-made) operating system on different hardware.

There isn't any real goal or plan, I'm mostly fumbling around for fun while learning a lot in the process. So I guess fun and learning could be called the main two goals.

The design of this bootloader has and will change a lot. This book is mostly a collection of my thoughts while developing this bootloader.

When I start working on my operating system, this book will probably be merged into a book for that operating system.
