# Todo List

## General

* Create cross-platform interface for interacting with a file system on any device
* ELF loader
* Ustar archive API

## Build Process

* Copy OVMF without hardcoded paths?
* Write script to ensure that build dependencies are installed (mtools, parted, cargo, dd, etc.)
* Write script to install build dependencies for each host system
* Option for QEMU KVM if target and host architectures are the same and kvm is enabled on host

## Architectures

* Test out different GDT setups
* Start more research into IDT
