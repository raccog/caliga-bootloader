# Todo List

* New Makefile
    * Copy OVMF without hardcoded paths?
    * Write host-specific scripts for disk partitioning/formatting (MacOS is not compatible with the current Makefile)
    * Ensure all necessary tools are installed on host
    * Option for QEMU KVM if enabled on host
* Research autoconf usage with Makefiles to see if it would help with cross-platform host setup
* Test out different GDT setups
* Start more research into IDT
