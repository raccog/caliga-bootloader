# Todo List

* Build process
    * Copy OVMF without hardcoded paths?
    * Write script to ensure that build dependencies are installed (mtools, parted, cargo, dd, etc.)
    * Write script to install build dependencies for each host system
    * Option for QEMU KVM if target and host architectures are the same and kvm is enabled on host
* Test out different GDT setups
* Start more research into IDT
